## Pins

#### Digital Pins

<details>
  <summary>Source</summary>
	
 <a href="https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/microcontrollers/digital-pins/">Arduino Docs</a>  
  </details>
The pins on the Arduino can be configured as either inputs or outputs. 

**Pin as INPUT**

Input pins are highly sensitive and require very little current to change state, similar to having a 100 MŒ© resistor in series. This makes them useful for capacitive touch sensors, LED-based light detection, or analog sensing using techniques like RCTime.

However, if an input pin is left unconnected (<code>pinMode(pin, INPUT);</code>), it can pick up electrical noise or be influenced by nearby pins, leading to random state changes.

**Pin as OUTPUT**

OUTPUT pins are in a low-impedance state, meaning they can provide significant current (up to 40 mA) to other circuits. This is enough to power LEDs (with a resistor) and some sensors, but not high-power devices like relays, solenoids, or motors.

Short circuits or excessive current draw can damage the pin‚Äôs output transistors or even the entire Atmega chip. To prevent this, it's recommended to use 470Œ© or 1kŒ© resistors when connecting OUTPUT pins to other devices unless maximum current is necessary.

#### Analog Input Pins

The Atmega328 has several pins that can function as analog inputs. These pins can measure continuous voltage levels, allowing you to interface with analog sensors like
temperature sensors, light sensors, potentiometers, etc. The microcontroller's built-in analog-to- digital converter (ADC) converts the analog voltage into a digital value that can be processed by the microcontroller.

The analog pins can be used identically to the digital pins, using the aliases A0 (for analog input 0), A1, etc. For example, the code would look like this to set analog pin 0 to an output, and to set it HIGH:
<code>pinMode(A0, OUTPUT);
digitalWrite(A0, HIGH);</code>

#### Power and Ground Pins

Power and Ground Pins: Essential for powering the microcontroller and providing a reference voltage. VCC (power supply voltage) and GND (ground) pins are critical for proper operation.

#### Reset Pin

Reset Pin: This pin is used to reset the microcontroller. Applying a reset pulse to this pin initializes the microcontroller's program execution from the beginning.

## Question 1: LED connection

> The LED peripherals can be connected in two ways using a ‚Äúcurrent limiting resistor‚Äù between the atmega328 PINs and the LED(s).
> Which alternative lights up the LED when the output pin is LOW and why?

The LED will light up when the output pin is LOW if the LED is connected in a "sinking" configuration (also called active-low).
There are two ways to connect an LED with a current-limiting resistor to an Arduino pin:

<table>
	<tr><th>Active-High (Source Current Configuration)</th>
	<th>Active-Low (Sink Current Configuration)</th></tr>
	<tr>
	<td><ul><li>
		LED anode (+) ‚Üí Arduino pin
	</li>
	<li>LED cathode (-) ‚Üí Resistor ‚Üí GND</li>
	<li>LED lights up when the pin is HIGH (provides current)</li></ul></td>
	<td><ul><li>LED anode (+) ‚Üí VCC (5V)</li><li>LED cathode (-) ‚Üí Resistor ‚Üí Arduino pin</li><li>LED lights up when the pin is LOW (creates a path to GND, sinking current)</li></ul></td>
	</tr>
</table>

**Why does the LED light up when the pin is LOW?**

In the sinking configuration, setting the pin LOW allows current to flow from VCC (5V) through the LED to the pin, which acts as a path to ground.
The current flows, and the LED turns ON.
When the pin is set HIGH, no voltage difference exists across the LED, so it stays OFF.

This method is commonly used in circuits where multiple LEDs share a common positive voltage (VCC) and are individually controlled by grounding the cathode through a microcontroller pin.

## üö¶üöô Traffic Lights

> Traffic light: use 3 Coloured LEDs to create a traffic light

```C++
int carRed = 12;    // Car traffic light pins
int carYellow = 11;
int carGreen = 10;
int shortDelay = 200;  // 200ms delay
int longDelay = 500;   // 500ms delay

void setup() {
  pinMode(carRed, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(carYellow, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(carGreen, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(carGreen, HIGH);  // Start with green light ON
}

void loop() {
  changeLights();
}

void changeLights() {

  // Green ‚Üí Yellow ‚Üí Red
  digitalWrite(carGreen, LOW);   // Turn off Green
  digitalWrite(carYellow, HIGH); // Turn on Yellow
  delay(shortDelay);
  digitalWrite(carYellow, LOW);  // Turn off Yellow
  digitalWrite(carRed, HIGH);    // Turn on Red

  delay(longDelay);

  // Red ‚Üí Yellow ‚Üí Green
  digitalWrite(carRed, LOW);     // Turn off Red
  digitalWrite(carYellow, HIGH); // Turn on Yellow
  delay(shortDelay);
  digitalWrite(carYellow, LOW);  // Turn off Yellow
  digitalWrite(carGreen, HIGH);  // Turn on Green

  delay(longDelay);
}
```

## üî¥ Pushbutton

<details>
  <summary>Source</summary>
	
 <a href="https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/functions/digital-io/digitalread/">Arduino Docs</a>  
  </details>
  
> when the button is pushed, the input pin will go to LOW

```C++
int btn = 2;   // Button connected to pin 2
int led = 13;  // LED connected to pin 13

void setup() {
  pinMode(btn, INPUT_PULLUP); // Use internal pull-up resistor
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  if (digitalRead(btn) == LOW) { // Button is pressed
    digitalWrite(led, HIGH);     // Turn LED ON
  } else {
    digitalWrite(led, LOW);      // Turn LED OFF
  }
}
```

<table>
	<tr><th>When OUTPUT is HIGH(button is not pressed, led is OFF)</th>
	<th>When OUTPUT is LOW(button is pressed, led is ON)</th></tr>
	<tr><td><img width=400 height=auto src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6e62f20-07f4-4aaf-abcc-6c7b54b693aa'></td>
	<td><img width=400 height=auto src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bdc9f12-338e-48fa-80ae-7fae1783456a'>
</td></tr>
</table>

```C++
int ledPin = 2; // LED connected to digital pin 2
int inPin = 7; // pushbutton connected to digital pin 7
int val = 0; // variable to store the read value
void setup() {
pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT); // sets the digital pin 2 as output
pinMode(inPin, INPUT); // sets the digital pin 7 as input
}
void loop() {
val = digitalRead(inPin); // read the input pin
digitalWrite(ledPin, val); // sets the LED to the button's value
}
```

> Button not pressed: pin 7 will read HIGH and LED will stay OFF.
> 
> Button pressed: pin 7 will read LOW, and the LED will turn ON.
> 
> The "Latch" function in simulation tools like UnoArduSim is typically used to simulate the button being pressed without having to physically hold it down.
> 
> With Latch: The button pin will act like it‚Äôs being held down (pressed) without needing to continuously press it.
> When you enable the latch, the button state >will stay LOW until you manually reset it or disable the latch.

## Question 2: LED resistor combination

> What combinations of the LED resistor configuration and the pushbutton rising/falling signal make the LED light up?

**LED Resistor Configuration:**

<ins>Current-limiting resistor:</ins> This resistor is placed in series with the LED to prevent excessive current from damaging the LED. The value of this resistor depends on the operating voltage of the LED and the voltage provided by the Arduino pin.

The LED will only light up when there is a voltage difference across it, with the correct current flowing through it.

**Pushbutton Signal:**

<ins>Rising edge:</ins> A transition from LOW to HIGH. This occurs when the button is released (assuming an active-low configuration).

<ins>Falling edge:</inss> A transition from HIGH to LOW. This occurs when the button is pressed (again assuming an active-low configuration).

**Button Signal Configurations:**

<ins>Active-Low (Most Common for Buttons):</ins>

In this configuration, the input pin is HIGH when the button is not pressed (due to a pull-up resistor), and the input pin goes LOW when the button is pressed.

<ins>Active-High (Less Common):</ins>

In this configuration, the input pin is LOW when the button is not pressed, and the input pin goes HIGH when the button is pressed.

**Combinations of Pushbutton Signal and LED Resistor Configurations:**

<ins>Active-Low Button (Button Connects to GND when Pressed):</ins>

In this case, we will use an internal pull-up resistor (<code>INPUT_PULLUP</code>) on the input pin.

Button **not pressed:** Pin reads **HIGH** (because the internal pull-up resistor pulls it to **HIGH**).

Button **pressed:** Pin reads **LOW** (because the button connects the pin to **GND**).

**LED Behavior:**

<table>
	<tr><th>    With Rising Edge (Button Released):
</th>
	<th>With Falling Edge (Button Pressed):</th></tr>
	<tr><td> The LED will turn ON when the input pin transitions from LOW to HIGH (button is released), assuming that the LED is connected to the pin that will turn HIGH on release.</td><td>The LED will turn ON when the input pin transitions from HIGH to LOW (button is pressed), assuming that the LED is connected to the pin that will turn LOW on press.</td></tr>
</table>

**Circuit Example (Active-Low):**

```C++
int ledPin = 2; // LED connected to digital pin 2
int btnPin = 7; // Button connected to digital pin 7
void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(btnPin, INPUT_PULLUP); // Use internal pull-up resistor
}
void loop() {
  if (digitalRead(btnPin) == LOW) { // Button is pressed (LOW)
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);     // Turn on the LED
  } else {
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);      // Turn off the LED
  }
}
```

> LED lights up when button is pressed, because the button is active-low (pin reads LOW when pressed).

**Active-High Button (Button Connects to VCC when Pressed):**

In this case, we do not use the internal pull-up resistor, so the input pin will need a pull-down resistor to ensure a known **LOW** state when the button is not pressed.

Button **not pressed:** Pin reads **LOW** (due to the pull-down resistor).

Button **pressed:** Pin reads **HIGH** (button connects pin to VCC).

**LED Behavior:**

<table>
	<tr><th>With Rising Edge (Button Pressed):</th><th>With Falling Edge (Button Released):</th></tr>
	<tr><td>The LED will turn ON when the input pin transitions from LOW to HIGH (button is pressed), assuming the LED is connected to the pin that turns HIGH on button press.</td><td>The LED will turn ON when the input pin transitions from HIGH to LOW (button is released), assuming the LED is connected to the pin that turns LOW on button release.</td></tr>
</table>

**Circuit Example (Active-High):**

```C++
int ledPin = 2; // LED connected to digital pin 2
int btnPin = 7; // Button connected to digital pin 7
void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(btnPin, INPUT); // Use external pull-down resistor to keep pin LOW when button is not pressed
}
void loop() {
  if (digitalRead(btnPin) == HIGH) { // Button is pressed (HIGH)
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);      // Turn on the LED
  } else {
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);       // Turn off the LED
  }
}
```

>LED lights up when the button is pressed, because the button is active-high (pin reads HIGH when pressed).

**Summary of LED Light-Up Combinations:**
<table>
	<tr><th>Button Configuration</th><th>Button Behavior</th><th>LED Behavior (Rising/Falling Edge)</th></tr>
	<tr><td>Active-Low (with pull-up)</td><td>Button pressed = LOW</td><td>Rising Edge (Release): LED ON when released
Falling Edge (Press): LED ON when pressed</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Active-High (with pull-down)</td><td>Button pressed = HIGH</td><td>Rising Edge (Press): LED ON when pressed
Falling Edge (Release): LED ON when released</td></tr>
</table>

**Key Points to Remember:**

<ul>
<li>Active-Low is more common in button circuits, using internal pull-up resistors.</li>

<li>Active-High can be used with a pull-down resistor for defining the LOW state when the button is not pressed.</li>

<li>The LED turns on depending on whether the input pin goes HIGH or LOW based on the button's state.</li>
</ul>

## Question 3: Floating pin

>‚ÄúProperties of Pins Configured as INPUT‚Äù. What happens to the PIN voltage level if you have nothing connected to it?

**Floating Pin:**

When a pin is configured as **INPUT** and nothing is connected to it, the pin is **"floating"**.

This means that the voltage on the pin is <ins>undefined</ins> and can fluctuate randomly due to electrical noise or capacitance in the environment.

As a result, the pin will read unpredictable values‚Äîsometimes **HIGH**, sometimes **LOW**.

## Question 4: INPUT_PULLUP option

> What is the ‚ÄúINPUT_PULLUP‚Äù option?

The <code>INPUT_PULLUP</code> option in Arduino configures a pin as an input with an internal pull-up resistor enabled.

**Internal Pull-Up Resistor:** It connects the input pin to **HIGH** (usually 5V) by default through an internal resistor (typically 20kŒ© to 50kŒ©).

**Pin Behavior:**

When the pin is not connected or floating, it will read **HIGH** (because of the pull-up resistor).
When the pin is connected to **GND** (e.g., when a button is pressed), it will read **LOW**.

It eliminates the need for an external resistor to keep the input pin in a defined state when no button or sensor is connected. It's especially useful for buttons or switches that connect the pin to **GND** when pressed.

<code>pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT_PULLUP);  // Use internal pull-up resistor</code>

> This ensures the pin will be HIGH when the button is not pressed and LOW when the button is pressed (connected to GND).

#### Using Two Pushbuttons

In programming, variables are used for temporary storage of data. They loose their values when the program finishes, typically in an embedded environment this means the microcontroller is reset or powered off.
In the Arduino programming language, integer-type variables are used primarily for storing **16-bit** whole numbers. The most commonly used integer type in Arduino is int.

> Write a program which reads two pushbuttons and controls one LED. 
> Note: // The input pins shall be latched and use pull-down resistors (transition to high)
> //the output LED shall have resistor to Ground

**LED lights up when both buttons are pressed (AND condition)**

```C++
int btn1 = 7; // Button 1 connected to pin 7
int btn2 = 6; // Button 2 connected to pin 6
int ledPin = 2; // LED connected to pin 2

void setup() {
  pinMode(btn1, INPUT); // Button 1 with pull-down resistor
  pinMode(btn2, INPUT); // Button 2 with pull-down resistor
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT); // LED pin as output
}

void loop() {

  // Read button states
  int stateBtn1 = digitalRead(btn1);
  int stateBtn2 = digitalRead(btn2);
  
  // If both buttons are pressed, light up the LED
  if (stateBtn1 == HIGH && stateBtn2 == HIGH) {
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); // Turn on LED
  } else {
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW); // Turn off LED
  }
}
```

> The LED shall light up either when both buttons have been pressed, or only one of them has been pressed.

## Serial Monitor

**8 Data Bits, 1 Stop Bit, No Parity Bit (8N1)**

This describes the frame format used in serial communication.

<ins>8 Data Bits</ins> ‚Üí Each transmitted data packet consists of 8 bits (1 byte).

<ins>1 Stop Bit</ins> ‚Üí A stop bit is used to signal the end of a transmission (it allows the receiver to know when a new data frame starts).

<ins>No Parity Bit</ins> ‚Üí Parity is used for error checking, but in this case, it is not used (hence, "No Parity").

> "8N1" is a common serial format, meaning:

<code>[Start Bit] + 8 Data Bits + [No Parity] + 1 Stop Bit</code>

**Baud Rate vs. Bit Speed**

These terms relate to the speed of communication between devices.

<ins>Baud Rate</ins> ‚Üí The number of symbols (signals) transmitted per second.

<ins>Bit Speed</ins> ‚Üí The number of bits transmitted per second.

**Why Are They Different?**

If each symbol represents one bit, then baud rate = bit speed.

Some communication protocols use multiple bits per symbol, making the bit speed higher than the baud rate.

> Note: In Arduino Serial Communication, baud rate (e.g., 9600 baud) typically equals bit speed (9600 bits per second).

**How This Affects UnoArduSim?**

When configuring the Serial Monitor in UnoArduSim, you need to set:
<ul>
	<li>Baud rate (must match Serial.begin(baudRate); in code).
</li>
	<li>8N1 as the frame format (default for Arduino).
</li>
	<li>Make sure to open the Serial Monitor after uploading the code.
</li>
</ul>

**Example:**

```C++
void setup() {

Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
Serial.print("Hello World!");
delay(1000);
}
```

**Explanation**
<table>
	<tr><td>
	<code>void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}
</code>	
	</td>
 <td><code>Serial.begin(9600);</code> initializes the serial communication between the Arduino and your computer.
9600 is the baud rate, meaning the communication speed is 9600 bits per second.
This allows data to be sent and received via the Serial Monitor </td></tr>
	<tr><td>
```C++
void loop() {
  Serial.print("Hello World!");
  delay(1000);
}
```
	</td>
	<td><code>Serial.print("Hello World!");</code> sends the text <code>"Hello World!"</code> to the Serial Monitor.
<code>delay(1000); </code>pauses execution for 1000 milliseconds (1 second) before repeating.</td></tr>
</table>

**Idle State (HIGH)**

The TX (transmit) pin sits at HIGH (1) when no data is being sent. This is the default idle state of UART communication.

**Start Bit (LOW)**

When sending a character like 'a', serial communication starts by sending a start bit, which is always LOW (0).

**Data Bits (LSB First)**

The binary representation of 97 ('a') is 0110 0001.
But because UART sends data LSB (Least Significant Bit) first, the order is 1000 0110.

**Stop Bit (HIGH)**

After sending the data bits, a stop bit (always HIGH) is transmitted to signal the end of the byte.

**How to Calculate the Time for a Single Bit?**

The time for a single bit in serial communication is determined by the baud rate (bits per second). The formula is:

Bit time = 1/Baud rate

This gives us the duration of one bit in seconds.

**Time for a Single Bit at 1200 baud**
   
Bit time = 1/1200‚Äã seconds

=0.0008333 seconds=0.8333 milliseconds=833.3 microseconds
=0.0008333 seconds=0.8333 milliseconds=833.3 microseconds

üëâ Each bit lasts 833.3 ¬µs (microseconds) at 1200 baud.

**Time for a Single Bit at 9600 baud**

Bit time = 1/9600 seconds

=0.0001042 seconds=0.1042 milliseconds=104.2 microseconds

üëâ Each bit lasts 104.2 ¬µs (microseconds) at 9600 baud.

**What Does This Mean?**

At 1200 baud, bits take **longer** to transmit (833.3 ¬µs per bit), making them easier to observe in the waveform.

At 9600 baud, bits are much **faster** (104.2 ¬µs per bit), making them harder to see.

#### Receiving serial data

```C++
void setup(){

Serial.begin(9600);
Serial.setTimeout(10000);
}
void loop(){

Serial.println("Enter data:");
while (Serial.available() == 0){

} //wait for data available
String teststr = Serial.readString(); //read until timeout
teststr.trim(); // remove any \r \n whitespace at the end of the String

if (teststr == "red"){
Serial.println("A primary color");
}else{
Serial.println("Something else");
}
}
```

This code reads a string input from the Serial Monitor and checks if the user typed "red". If "red" is received, it prints "A primary color"; otherwise, it prints "Something else".

1. <code>Serial.setTimeout(10000);</code>

This function sets the timeout for serial reading functions (like <code>Serial.readString()</code>).

10000 means 10 seconds. If no data is received within this time, <code>Serial.readString()</code> will return whatever it has received so far (even if it's incomplete).

Without this, <code>readString()</code> could hang indefinitely if no data arrives.

2. <code>while (Serial.available() == 0) { } // wait for data</code>

This waits for the user to enter data.

The program freezes here until at least one character is received in the Serial buffer.

3. <code>String teststr = Serial.readString();</code>

Reads the entire available input until a timeout occurs or the user presses Enter (<code>\n</code> or <code>\r</code>).

Since <code>Serial.setTimeout(10000)</code> is used, if the user types nothing for 10 seconds, <code>Serial.readString()</code> will return an empty string.

4. <code>teststr.trim();</code>
Removes any extra whitespace, <code>\r</code>, or <code>\n</code> from the input.

Why? When pressing Enter, Serial Monitor sends "\n" or "\r\n", which could mess up the comparison (teststr == "red").

5. Checking the Input
```C++
if (teststr == "red") {
    Serial.println("A primary color");
} else {
    Serial.println("Something else");
}
```

If the user typed "red", it prints "A primary color".

Otherwise, it prints "Something else".

> What does the Serial.setTimeout() function call achieve? Is there an unnecessary delay in the code?

Yes, there is a potential delay:

<code>Serial.setTimeout(10000);</code> could cause up to 10 seconds of waiting if the user types nothing.

This is unnecessary if we assume the user will always press Enter after typing.

A lower timeout (e.g., 500 ms) would work better.

**Optimized Code (Non-Blocking Approach)**

```C++
void setup() {

    Serial.begin(9600);
    Serial.setTimeout(500);  // Reduced timeout to 500ms instead of 10 seconds
}

void loop() {

    Serial.println("Enter data:");
    if (Serial.available() > 0) {  // Only proceed if there is input
        String teststr = Serial.readString();
        teststr.trim();  // Remove whitespace and newline characters
        if (teststr == "red") {
            Serial.println("A primary color");
        } else {
            Serial.println("Something else");
        }
    }
    delay(500);  // Small delay to avoid spamming Serial Monitor
}
```

## Question 5: readStringUntil() method

>  What the readStringUntil() method does?

The Serial.readStringUntil(char terminator) method reads characters from the serial buffer until:

The specified terminator character is encountered.

The timeout <code>(Serial.setTimeout())</code> expires.

## Read an input from a user

> reads input from the serial monitor;
> prints output to the serial monitor;

<table>
<tr><th>Input</th><th>Output</th></tr>
	<tr><td>red</td><td>yellow</td></tr>
	<tr><td>yellow</td><td>red</td></tr>
	<tr><td>green</td><td>green</td></tr>
	
</table>

> Note: If the read data is something else than one of the options above, an error message is printed.

<code>void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);  // Start serial communication
    Serial.setTimeout(500);  // Set timeout for Serial.readString()
}
void loop() {
    Serial.println("Enter a color (red, yellow, green):");
    if (Serial.available() > 0) {  // Check if data is available
        String input = Serial.readStringUntil('\n');  // Read input until newline
        input.trim();  // Remove any extra spaces or newlines
        // Check the input and print the corresponding output
        if (input == "red") {
            Serial.println("Output: yellow");
        } else if (input == "yellow") {
            Serial.println("Output: green");
        } else if (input == "green") {
            Serial.println("Output: red");
        } else {
            Serial.println("Error: Invalid input!");
        }
    }

    delay(500);  // Small delay to prevent spamming the Serial Monitor
}
</code>

## Bit-level access

Bit operations play a crucial role in embedded systems for among others, the following reasons:

‚Ä¢ Memory Efficiency: Embedded systems often operate in resource-constrained environments
with limited memory. Bit operations allow you to pack multiple binary flags or configuration
options into a single memory location, conserving precious memory space.
‚Ä¢ I/O Control: Embedded systems frequently interact with various hardware peripherals and
sensors, where individual bits in control registers configure and control device behavior. Bit
manipulation is essential for setting, clearing, or toggling specific bits in these registers.
‚Ä¢ Interrupt Handling: In interrupt-driven systems, bit flags often signal various events or
conditions. Efficiently managing and checking these flags is crucial for responding to events
promptly and accurately.

  <summary>Source</summary>
	
 <a href="https://docs.arduino.cc/retired/hacking/software/PortManipulation/">To read more: Arduino PortManipulation, Docs</a>  
  </details>

>The UnoArduSim environment doesn‚Äôt support register manipulation, only the functions provided to set port/pin states are emulated.
>We can however study bit operators by using a single char variable, manipulating that and printing the results to the Serial Monitor.

**Example:**

<code>unsigned char count;  // Declares an 8-bit unsigned character (0 to 255)
void setup() {
    count = 200;        // Initializes count to 200
    Serial.begin(9600); // Starts the Serial Monitor at 9600 baud rate
}
void loop() {
    count = count + 1;  // Increments count by 1
    Serial.println(count, BIN); // Prints count in binary format
    delay(1000);        // Waits 1 second
}
</code>

**Program Output Example:**

<code>11001001  // 201
11001010  // 202
11001011  // 203
...
11111111  // 255 (Max Value)
00000000  // 0  (Overflow occurs!)
00000001  // 1
...
</code>

> Note: Since unsigned char is only 8 bits (0 to 255), after reaching 255, the next increment makes it wrap around to 0 (like a circular counter).

## Negative Values

**Modified code:**

<code>char count;  // Changed from "unsigned char" to "char"
void setup() {
    count = 100;       // Changed from 200 to 100
    Serial.begin(9600);
}
void loop() {
    count = count + 1;  // Increment count by 1
    Serial.println(count, BIN);  // Print count in binary format
    delay(1000);
}
</code>

**Program Output Example:**

<code>01100101  // 101
01100110  // 102
...
01111111  // 127 (Max value for signed char)
10000000  // -128 (Overflow occurs!)
10000001  // -127
10000010  // -126
...
00000000  // 0
00000001  // 1
</code>

**Changed unsigned char to char:**
<ul>
<li>unsigned char could hold values from 0 to 255.</li>
<li>char (signed) holds values from -128 to 127. Now, count can store negative values</li>
</ul>

**What Happens in the Serial Monitor?**

<ul>
<li>The program increments count by 1 every second.</li>
<li>When count reaches 127, it overflows to -128 because char is signed.</li>
<li>    Then, count keeps increasing (-127, -126, ... 0, 1, 2, ...).</li>
</ul>

**Why Does This Happen?**

Signed char uses 8-bit Two's Complement format:
<ul>
<li>Positive numbers: 0 to 127 (00000000 to 01111111).</li>
<li>Negative numbers: -128 to -1 (10000000 to 11111111).</li>
<li>When count goes above 127, it wraps around to -128.</li>
</ul>

## Selecting a single bit from a group of 8 bits

**The bit-level & operation**

The bitwise AND (&) operation performs a logical AND between corresponding bits of two numbers.

üîπ How It Works (Bit-Level):

It compares each bit of the first number with the corresponding bit of the second number.
The result is 1 only if both bits are 1; otherwise, the result is 0.

**Example:**

<code>int a = 5;   // Binary:  00000101
int b = 3;   // Binary:  00000011
int c = a & b; // Bitwise AND
Serial.println(c); // Output: 1
</code>

üîç Step-by-Step (Bitwise Operation)

<code>00000101  (5 in binary)
&  00000011  (3 in binary)
Result:
   00000001  (1 in binary) ‚Üí Result: 1
</code>

**Key Properties:**

‚úî Used to mask bits (turn off unwanted bits).
‚úî Can check if specific bits are set.
‚úî Often used for bitwise flags in embedded systems and microcontrollers.

**Example:**

<code>#define BITMASK 0x02  // BITMASK is defined as 0x02 (Binary: 00000010)
unsigned char value = 7;  // value is 7 (Binary: 00000111)
unsigned char result;
result = value & BITMASK; // Perform bitwise AND operation
</code>

**Step-by-Step Execution**

1Ô∏è‚É£ Convert Values to Binary
value = 7 ‚Üí Binary: 00000111
BITMASK = 0x02 ‚Üí Binary: 00000010

2Ô∏è‚É£ Apply Bitwise AND (&)
<code>   00000111   (7 in binary)
&  00000010   (BITMASK: 2 in binary)
Result:
   00000010   (Result: 2 in binary)
</code>

3Ô∏è‚É£ Store the Result
result = 2 (Decimal) ‚Üí Binary: 00000010

üìù What Does This Code Do?

‚úî Masks out all bits except bit 1 (second bit from the right).
‚úî Checks whether bit 1 of value is set.
‚úî If value has bit 1 set (1), result is 2 (0x02). Otherwise, result is 0.

üîç What Happens When value Changes?

The bitwise AND (&) operation isolates bit 1 (second bit from the right) of value.
Since BITMASK = 0x02 (Binary: 00000010), the result depends on whether bit 1 in value is 1 or 0.

üí° Example Scenarios

|value|	Binary (value)|value & BITMASK|	result|
|---|---|---|---|
|0|	00000000 |	00000000 |	0|
|1 |	00000001 |	00000000 |	0|
|2 |	00000010 |	00000010 |	2|
|3 |	00000011 |	00000010|	2|
|4 |	00000100 |	00000000|	0|
|7 |	00000111 |	00000010|	2|

> If bit 1 (second bit) is 1, result will be 2 (since 0x02 = 2).
> If bit 1 is 0, result will be 0.

**How to Make result be 1 or 0 Instead of 2 or 0?**

<code>result = (value & BITMASK) >> 1;</code>

This shifts bit 1 to bit 0, making result either 1 or 0.

üìå Example With Shifting

|value	|Binary (value)	|value & BITMASK	|Shift >> 1	|result|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|0	|00000000	|00000000	|00000000	|0|
|1	|00000001	|00000000	|00000000	|0|
|2	|00000010	|00000010	|00000001	|1|
|3	|00000011	|00000010	|00000001	|1|
|4	|00000100	|00000000	|00000000	|0|
|7	|00000111	|00000010	|00000001	|1|

> Now, result is 1 if bit 1 is set, otherwise 0.

**Example:**

<code>#define BITMASK 0x02
unsigned char value;
unsigned char result;
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}
void loop() {
  for (value = 0; value <= 7; value++) { // Testing values from 0 to 7
    result = (value & BITMASK) >> 1;
    Serial.print("Value: ");
    Serial.print(value, BIN); // Print value in binary
    Serial.print(" -> Result: ");
    Serial.println(result);
    delay(1000);
  }
}

**Example:**

<code>int ledPin = 9; // LED connected to digital pin 9
int analogPin = A0; // potentiometer connected to analog pin A0
int val = 0; // variable to store the read value
void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT); // set LED pin as OUTPUT
  pinMode(analogPin, INPUT); // set the analog pin as INPUT
  Serial.begin(9600); // start the Serial Monitor at 9600 baud rate
}
void loop() {
  val = analogRead(analogPin); // read the input pin (potentiometer)
  Serial.println(val); // print the potentiometer value to the Serial Monitor
  // Turn the LED on if the voltage on the pin is near 5V (1023 in analogRead)
  if (val > 1000) { 
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); // turn LED on
  } else {
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW); // turn LED off
  }
  delay(100); // small delay to avoid spamming the Serial Monitor
}
</code>

**Explanation:**

<code>analogPin = A0;</code>: The analog pin where the potentiometer is connected should be an analog input pin. On most Arduino boards, these are labeled as A0, A1, etc.
<code>pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);</code>: The ledPin is set as an output because you're controlling an LED.
<code>pinMode(analogPin, INPUT);</code>: The analog pin (A0 in this case) is set as an input because you're reading the value from the potentiometer.
<code>val = analogRead(analogPin);</code>: Reads the analog value from the potentiometer. The value returned will be between 0 (0V) and 1023 (5V), as the Arduino converts the analog voltage into a 10-bit number.
<code>Serial.println(val);</code>: Sends the value of the potentiometer to the Serial Monitor for viewing.

**LED Control:**

if (val > 1000): If the analog value is greater than 1000 (close to 5V), the LED will be turned on.
<code>digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);</code>: Turns the LED on.
<code>digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);</code>: Turns the LED off.
<code>delay(100);</code>: Adds a small delay to prevent flooding the Serial Monitor with too many readings.

**How It Works:**

The potentiometer gives a value between 0 (0V) and 1023 (5V).
If the potentiometer's value is greater than 1000, the LED turns on (indicating the potentiometer is at or near 5V).
If the value drops below 1000, the LED turns off.
The value is printed on the Serial Monitor, which you can see in real-time.

**Testing:**

When the potentiometer is turned to its maximum (5V), the LED will turn on.
When the potentiometer is turned to its minimum (0V), the LED will turn off.
The serial monitor will display values ranging from 0 to 1023 depending on the position of the potentiometer.


## Question 6: analogRead() function

> In what form does the analogRead() function return the analog voltage on the Pin?

The <code>analogRead()</code> function in Arduino returns the analog voltage from a specified analog pin in the form of an integer. This value represents the digital approximation of the analog voltage, mapped between 0 and 1023.

**Breakdown:**

The Arduino board uses a 10-bit ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) to convert the input analog voltage into a digital value.
The ADC operates with a reference voltage (typically 5V on most Arduino boards, or 3.3V on some others).
The analog value is mapped from the range of 0 to 1023.

**Example:**

0 corresponds to 0V (ground).
1023 corresponds to the reference voltage (typically 5V).

**Formula:**

The analog value val returned by analogRead(pin) can be interpreted using the following formula:

<code>voltage = (val / 1023.0) * referenceVoltage</code>

**Where:**

val is the value returned by analogRead()
referenceVoltage is typically 5V (unless configured otherwise)

**For example:**

If analogRead() returns 512, that corresponds to approximately half of the reference voltage, i.e., around 2.5V (if using a 5V reference).

<code>int sensorValue = analogRead(A0); // Read analog value from pin A0
float voltage = sensorValue * (5.0 / 1023.0); // Convert to voltage (assuming 5V reference)
Serial.println(voltage); // Print the voltage value
</code>

# Arduino Environment

# Arduino UNO hardware Basics, LTSpice Simulation

A breadboard is commonly used for testing and learning circuit connections. It is divided into rows, which are separated in two different ways. The spacing between two adjacent holes is **2.54 mm**, matching the pin distance in **DIL-packaged (Dual In-Line)**  circuits.

A typical breadboard is shown:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c76b0aac-8bdc-4819-a712-3c40fec01051" alt="Description of image" width="800">
  <br>
  <em>Breadboard</em>
</p>

The **red line** represents the **positive** voltage rail, where the holes are connected horizontally (shorted). This means the positive supply voltage should be distributed along this line.

The blue line is separate from the red one and also connected horizontally, typically used for the **ground (GND)** potential.

Regarding the main terminal rows:

The holes labeled A to J are separated horizontally. However, within each column, the holes are vertically connected. There is a gap between columns E and F, meaning connections do not extend across this break.

This structure allows for easy prototyping without soldering.

A **DIL (Dual In-Line)** package is shown from a top view. Typically, the pins are numbered with pin 1 located at the bottom-left corner. The numbering continues from left to right on the bottom row and then from right to left on the top row.

#### Q1: Calculate Resisitance

Question 1: Calculate the **Ohm** value of this series resistor for the green LED (D1) using a **5V** supply. The
LED current consumption is **4 mA**, and its threshold voltage is **2.28 V**. Use this Ohm value in the
simulation.

**Given Data:**

<ul>
	<li> Supply voltage (VsVs‚Äã) = 5V</li>
	<li> LED forward voltage (VfVf‚Äã) = 2.28V</li>
	<li> LED current (II) = 4 mA = 0.004 A</li>
</ul>

Ohm's Law Formula:

$R = \frac{Vs - Vf}{I}$

Substituting the Values:

$R = \frac{5V - 2.28V}{0.004A}$

$R = \frac{2.72V}{0.004A}$

$R = 680Œ©$

##### Simulation

#### Q2: Connect Voltage source directly to LED

> What is the Current through LED D1 if it will be connected LED D1 to Voltage source +5V?

If you connect +5V directly to the LED (D1) without a series resistor, the current will be excessively high and can damage the LED. Let's calculate the expected current using Ohm‚Äôs Law.
Given Data:
<ul>
	<li>Supply Voltage (VsVs‚Äã) = 5V</li>
	<li>LED Forward Voltage (VfVf‚Äã) = 2.28V</li>
	<li>LED Internal Resistance ‚âà Very Low (~0Œ©, negligible)</li>
</ul>

**Ohm‚Äôs Law:**

$I = \frac{V}{R}$

Since an LED doesn‚Äôt have significant resistance, the only resistance limiting the current is the internal resistance of the LED and the wiring, which is very small (typically a few ohms or less). This means the current can become very high (several hundreds of milliamps), far exceeding the LED‚Äôs safe operating limit of 4mA.

**What Happens?**

<ul>
	<li>The LED will likely burn out instantly.</li>
	<li>If the power supply can deliver enough current, it may overheat or even explode.</li>
	<li>In some cases, it may momentarily light up very brightly before failing permanently.</li>
</ul>

# Pins, Switches and Pull-Up Resistors

> With external 10 kŒ© pull-up resistors connected to pins 5, 6, 7, and 8, the pins will read HIGH when the switches are open (because of the pull-ups) and will read LOW when the switches are closed.

> [!NOTE]
> To test this - write the data from a input pin (which is connected to a switch) to the built-in LED on pin 13. This LED should shine when the switch to be tested is ON

```html-nolint
// Define the pins connected to the switches

**Y1 = AB + CD:** This means that the LED at pin 3 should turn ON if <ins>both</ins> switches A and B are pressed (i.e., A = LOW and B = LOW), or if both C and D are pressed.

**Y2 = (A + B)(C + D):** This means the LED at pin 4 should turn ON if either A or B is pressed and either C or D is pressed.

```

>[!NOTE]
>**LED Control:**
>LED on Pin 13: The built-in LED lights up when any switch is pressed (any pin reads LOW).
>LED on Pin 3 (Y1 = AB + CD): The LED lights up if A and B are both pressed (LOW) or if C and D are both pressed (LOW).
>LED on Pin 4 (Y2 = (A + B)(C + D)): The LED lights up if either A or B is pressed (LOW) and either C or D is pressed (LOW).

**Boolean Expressions Logic:**

**Y1 = AB + CD:** LED 2 (pin 3) will turn on if A and B are both pressed or C and D are both pressed.

**Y2 = (A + B)(C + D):** LED 3 (pin 4) will turn on if either A or B is pressed and either C or D is pressed.

**Result:**

Pin 13 (Built-in LED): Turns on when any switch (A, B, C, or D) is pressed.
Pin 3 (LED Y1): Lights up when either A and B are both pressed, or C and D are both pressed.
Pin 4 (LED Y2): Lights up when either A or B is pressed and either C or D is pressed.

#### Adding a Serial Monitor

> The switch > labels can be S1, S2, S3, and S4.
> Print the states of all switches only if the state of any switch has changed from the previous state.

>[!NOTE]
>To extend the system with Serial Monitor functionality:
<ul>
<li>Track the previous state of each switch.</li>
<li>Print the state of the switches (whether they are ON or OFF) only when the state has changed from the previous state.</li>

**Explanation of New Functionality:**

<ins>State Tracking Variables:</ins>
Four variables to store the current and previous states of each switch:

currentStateS1, currentStateS2, currentStateS3, currentStateS4 for the current state of switches S1, S2, S3, and S4.

previousStateS1, previousStateS2, previousStateS3, previousStateS4 for the previous state of each switch.

<ins>State Change Detection:</ins>

In the loop(), compare the current state of each switch to its previous state:

If any switch's state has changed (from LOW to HIGH or from HIGH to LOW), we print the new state of all switches.

<ins>Serial Monitor Printing:</ins>

If a state change is detected, we print the state of all switches to the Serial Monitor.

The state is printed as either "ON" if the switch is pressed (LOW), or "OFF" if the switch is open (HIGH).

<ins>Update Previous States:</ins>

After printing the state change, update the previousState variables to store the current states for comparison in the next loop iteration.

>Add functionality to the previous setup where, upon entering the number 1 in the serial terminal,
> the LED built into the development board switches to the ON state, and by entering the number 2, the LED switches to the OFF state.

**Logic:**

Check the Serial Monitor for incoming data (specifically, the numbers 1 and 2).

If the number 1 is received, the built-in LED (connected to pin 13) will be turned ON.

If the number 2 is received, the built-in LED (connected to pin 13) will be turned OFF.

 <ins>Serial Input for Controlling Built-in LED:</ins>

The program reads input from the Serial Monitor using Serial.read().

If the number 1 is entered, the built-in LED (on pin 13) will turn ON.

If the number 2 is entered, the built-in LED will turn OFF.

<ins>Feedback to the Serial Monitor:</ins>

When the LED is turned ON, a message "LED ON" is printed to the Serial Monitor.

When the LED is turned OFF, a message "LED OFF" is printed to the Serial Monitor.

<ins>Using Serial.available() and Serial.read():</ins>

The Serial.available() function checks if data is available in the serial buffer.

If data is available, we use Serial.read() to get the data. We then check if the received data is either '1' or '2' and control the LED accordingly.

<ins>Using Serial.println() to Provide Feedback:</ins>

After turning the LED on or off, we provide feedback to the Serial Monitor with "LED ON" or "LED OFF".
